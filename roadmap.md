Printify Creator Portal — World-Class System Blueprint
🎯 MISSION
To create a fully autonomous creative manufacturing and commerce platform. This portal:

Translates raw ideas into market-ready products

Generates everything (images, descriptions, variants, pricing)

Validates and evolves itself

Syncs with Printify + Etsy

Tracks sales, optimizes listings, and reinvests knowledge

Your creative agency becomes a self-improving, AI-managed brand factory.

🧠 Intelligent Agent Modules
Each module is an independent agent with internal logging, fallback plans, self-validation, and chainable APIs.

1. 📐 Blueprint Parser Agent
Accepts: .json, .txt, .md, voice transcript, sketch + keywords

Extracts:

Product intent

Tone/mood

Keywords

Variant notes

Auto-links to product type (coaster, hoodie, mug, etc.)

✅ Can summarize multi-sentence ideas
✅ Supports a "series mode" for multiple variations
✅ Tags emotion, metaphysical themes, archetypes

2. 🎨 Image Prompt Generator Agent
Uses sacred geometry logic, archetypal symbolism, vibe tags, mood layers

Generates image prompts using style tokens:

[VIBE] + [SYMBOL] + [MODIFIERS] + [SCENE]

Random or guided seed injection (for design series)

Prepares 5 variations per prompt automatically

✔ Integration-ready with SD, DALL·E, Midjourney API, or local
✔ Outputs negative prompts, style tags, and safety flags

3. ✅ Image Prompt QC Agent
Validates against:

Mismatched product (e.g. poster prompt for a mug)

Redundant wording

Misspellings, banned words

Triggers (sensitive content)

Suggests improvements inline

Outputs: prompt_final.json

🔥 Optionally auto-rewrites prompts using GPT-4o

4. 🧠 Image Generation Agent
Supports:

Local Stable Diffusion (A1111, ComfyUI)

External API image generation (like DALL·E)

Logs:

Prompt

Seed

Output image path

Model used

Render time

Includes watermarking toggle, preview-only mode, and batch mode

5. 📝 Metadata Generation Agent
Creates:

Product title (brand voice options)

Description (SEO-rich, soulful, or minimal)

Tags (weighted by trend relevance)

Locale-based variation (USD, EUR, etc.)

🧠 Can run in dry-run simulation mode
🧠 Logs every payload as product_payload_<timestamp>.json

8. 📡 Upload & Sync Agent
Handles:

Publishing to Etsy/Shopify

Error retries
