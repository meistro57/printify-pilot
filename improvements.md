Based on your repo’s documentation and roadmap, here are targeted suggestions to improve Printify Pilot’s functionality (and, by extension, its feature set):

## 1. Functional Improvements

- **Agent Robustness & Observability**
  - Ensure each intelligent agent (e.g., Blueprint Parser, Metadata Generation, Product Creator) is modular, unit-tested, and logs events with enough detail for debugging.
  - Add a unified error handling layer for all API interactions (Printify, Etsy, Shopify, etc.), with retries and alerting (email/Telegram as planned).

- **Background Task Reliability**
  - Expand Celery/RQ job tracking: expose job status and failures in your creator dashboard.
  - Implement job deduplication and idempotency to avoid accidental duplicate product creations or updates.

- **Metadata & SEO Automation**
  - Enhance the metadata QC agent to learn from successful product listings (track which wording/SEO strategies actually convert).
  - Periodically refresh tags/keywords using Etsy/Printify trend data (automated, not just at product creation).

- **Sync & Publishing Flow**
  - Make the sync agent self-healing: auto-detect and fix broken syncs (e.g., missing products, price mismatches).
  - Add change history/audit logging for all sync actions.

- **Testing & Validation**
  - Write integration tests that simulate end-to-end flows (blueprint → product → publish → sync).
  - Add dry-run/test modes everywhere (“simulate” a publish or sync without real API calls).

## 2. Feature/UX-Adjacent Enhancements

- **Dashboard UX**
  - Surface pipeline/job status (success, pending, failed) in real time in the dashboard.
  - Enable in-dashboard management: retry failed jobs, edit product metadata, or trigger a resync manually.

- **Analytics Agent**
  - Consolidate analytics: show not only Printify product performance, but how changes (metadata, pricing) affect sales over time.
  - Add actionable insights (e.g., “X products with Y tags sold 40% better last month”).

- **A/B Testing and Variant Management**
  - Automate creation and tracking of product variants with different images/descriptions.
  - Surface winning variants in the dashboard and allow promoting/demoting variants with a click.

- **Plugin API**
  - Document and stabilize the plugin interface so users can build and share their own automation modules.

## 3. Code/Architecture

- **Configuration Management**
  - Move sensitive config (tokens, API keys) out of code/config.py—use environment variables or a secrets manager.
  - Add config validation and clear error messages for misconfigurations.

- **Documentation**
  - Expand examples in README and inline docstrings for each agent.
  - Add a “Getting Started” flow with screenshots (especially of the dashboard).
