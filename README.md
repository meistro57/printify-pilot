# Printify Pilot

This repository is a placeholder for a future project that will explore the Printify API. At the moment it only contains the Apache 2.0 License. No source code or tools have been published yet.

Expect this repository to grow with scripts or examples for interacting with Printify, such as creating products, managing shops, or automating order workflow. Until then, there's nothing to build or run.
